# Don't use these notes

I'm an avid learner. It is something I do every day. 

This is my process to learn and retain technical material as quickly as possible:

* Read new material every day, for at least 30 minutes.
* Brainstorm questions that could be asked about the material as I read.
* Jot down the answers to those questions. Cite sources.

The outcome is a lot of questions and answers that are great to review when studying for an exam. Tougher questions I might copy onto physical note cards for study.

The process of creating these notes and note cards is what helps me learn, not the note cards themselves.

For that reason I don't want you to use these notes. I want you to create your own, so that you may learn üôè.
